# React Pokédex

Welcome to my attempt on a Pokédex react app, built with React, Typescript, Tailwind,
and a typescript wrapper for the PokéAPI called [Pokenode-ts](https://pokenode-ts-docs-gabb-c.vercel.app/docs/intro).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing

Assuming you forked and pulled (or downloaded the source of) this repo,
the following commands are needed to start up the app:

```shell
cd <parentPath>/pokedex
npm install
npm run start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:fix`

Lints `.ts` and `.tsx` files with Prettier.
When this results in any lint errors, you can fix them by running `npm run lint:fix`
